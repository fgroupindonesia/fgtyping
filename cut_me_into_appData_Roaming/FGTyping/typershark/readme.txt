1.0 REQUIRED SPEC / RECOMMENDED SPEC
========================================

1.1 	REQUIRED SPEC

with a Pentium II 200 MHz or better processor. Your computer must have 
at least 32 megabytes of RAM.

Operating System: you must be utilizing Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, or XP 
with DirectX 7 or later to play Typer Shark Deluxe for Windows on your 
system.

Controls: a keyboard and a 100% Microsoft compatible mouse are 
required.

Sound: you must have a DirectX certified sound card installed.

Video: you must have your desktop set to 16-bit or 32-bit Color
(256 Colors may not work).

1.2 	RECOMMENDED SPEC

PopCap recommends an IBM PC or 100% compatible computer, with a Pentium 
II 300 MHz or better processor and 128mb or more of memory.

=======================================
2.0 TROUBLESHOOTING / COMPATIBILITY
=======================================

For updates to this list please go to http://www.popcap.com.

2.1 	DirectX

Typer Shark Deluxe requires you to have DirectX 7 drivers or later 
installed. These are sound and video drivers from Microsoft used in many
games. If you need the latest version of DirectX, go to 
http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

2.2 	Screen Color Depth

Typer Shark Deluxe requires you to be running in 16bit color or better. It 
may not function in Windowed mode properly in 256 colors. If you are 
running in 256 colors, the game will try to switch to full-screen mode.

In addition, the game may run slowly in windowed mode in 32-bit Color. 
If this occurs, switch to full-screen mode, or change your color depth 
to 16 bits.

2.3 	Bug Reporting

Though we've tried our best to squash all the bugs, every once in a 
while something we didn't expect pops up...

If you should come across a bug in Typer Shark Deluxe, please report it to
bugs@popcap.com.

If for some reason the program crashes, it will try to capture any 
pertinent data and give you instructions on how to send that data to 
PopCap. This is very helpful for tracking down glitches! This 
information is also stored in a file called CRASH.TXT in your Typer Shark
Deluxe directory (C:\PROGRAM FILES\POPCAP GAMES\Typer Shark by 
default). If you can, include this text file with any email you send to 
PopCap about crashes.

====================
3.0 INSTRUCTIONS
====================

3.1 	INTRODUCTION

Typer Shark Deluxe is a typing tutor unlike any you've ever seen before! 
Dive deep into the ocean depths with only your keyboard for protection...
and zap menacing Word Sharks by typing the words printed on their sides.
Discover sunken treasure, or test your skills to
the max in the Abyss!

Typer Shark features three ways to play: you can choose your path by
progressing through the Adventure mode, play a fast arcade game in the
Abyss, or improve your typing skills with the Typing Tutor mode.

3.2	CREATING A PROFILE

If it's your first time playing, you'll be asked to create a profile
with your name. This is used to identify you in case there are multiple
people playing on the same machine: each can have separate saved games
and statistics. If you need to create a new profile later, just click on
the link that says, "Click here if this is not you." This will let you
pick a different profile or create a new one.

3.3 	GAME SELECTION

Once the game has finished loading, you will find yourself on the Game
Selector screen. If it is the first time you've launched Typer Shark, 
you'll be prompted to take a typing test to determine your current
typing speed. This will let the program recommend an appropriate skill
level for you to play at.

From this screen, you can select one of the three game modes: Adventure,
Abyss, and Tutorial, or access your Statistics. You can also change 
Game Options or Quit back to Windows.

3.4	GAME MODES

If you select Adventure mode, your recommended difficulty level will
be highlighted if you've taken the typing test. This is the level you
should probably start at to get a solid challenge. 

Pick a difficulty level to start the game. See ADVENTURE MODE later for
more details.

If you pick Abyss mode, you will start either at the surface, or at any
of the 400-foot markers you placed while previously playing Abyss. This
allows you to start at a deeper depth once you've proven your skills.

See ABYSS MODE later for more details.

If you pick the Typing Tutor, you will go to the Tutorial screen, where you
can improve your skills with one of 18 typing lessons. You can also
retake the typing test at any time to see your current words per minute.

See TYPING TUTOR later for more details.

3.5	OPTIONS

Click OPTIONS to change various in-game options. These include:

Music Volume
Sound Effects Volume:  You can control these independently with the 
sliders.

Full screen: If this box is checked, Typer Shark Deluxe will resize itself to 
fill the entire screen. If unchecked, it will appear in a window 
640x480 pixels across.

Enable FX: On slower computers, you may want to uncheck this box. This
will disable some of the underwater effects, but the program may
run faster.

Custom Cursors: If this box is checked, you will see special custom 
Typer Shark Deluxe cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. 
If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows 
cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the cursor 
properly in the game.

Space Bar Pauses Game: If you enable this option, pressing the Space Bar
will pause any game. This is off by default.

Register: Sooner or later you will want to register your copy of Typer Shark
online so you can remove the nag screens and loading delays, and 
activate the high scores and other features disabled in the Trial 
version. See the section on REGISTRATION later in the Readme.txt file. 

3.6	HALL OF FAME

You can check out the Hall of Fame to see the best scores in Adventure
and Abyss mode.

3.7	STATISTICS

Click on this to see your own personal statistics in Adventure, Abyss,
and Typing Tutor modes. See if you're improving over time!



=====================
4.0 ADVENTURE MODE
=====================

4.1 	OVERVIEW

Adventure mode lets you choose your path as you salvage shipwrecks
across the Seven Seas, and beyond, into the mysterious depths of the
infinate sea!

There are many different enemies and bonuses in Adventure Mode,
including special secret levels.

4.2	HOW TO PLAY

Sharks and other enemies will swim towards you from the right side of
the screen. Type the words printed on their sides to zap them! If they
reach the far left side of the screen, they will chomp you and you'll 
lose one of your three lives.

4.3	SHARK ZAPPER

Your Shark Zapper charges up over time and as you zap enemies. When it
is fully charged, you can use it to zap all enemies on screen at once!
Press ENTER to fire your Shark Zapper once it is charged.

4.4	SHIPWRECK BONUS

When you reach the ocean floor, you'll find a shipwreck hiding sunken
treasures. You have less than 30 seconds to recover as much as you can!
Type as many of the words that appear as you can before time runs out.

4.5	MAP SCREEN

Once you finish the shipwreck segment, you will go to a map screen
depicting your progress. In some cases, you may be able to choose your
next destination! Read the descriptions of each site carefully... some
are more dangerous than others!

4.6	OTHER ENEMIES

Keep an eye out as you advance, and you will see all sorts of different
foes to battle... ghost sharks, tiger sharks, hammerheads, piranhas,
and 4 different boss monsters! 

4.7	ENDLESS WATERS

If you make it to the end of the Adventure game, you'll have the option
of proceeding into the endless waters. Do you dare learn the secrets?

4.8	SECRETS

There are several special levels you can discover if you're clever! But
we'll leave that for you to figure out...

4.9	SAVED GAMES

Games are only saved at the beginning of a new level. So if you have 
completed a level and are on the map screen, make sure to select a new 
dive location before quitting out, otherwise you will have to replay the 
previous level when you restart the game later.


==============
5.0 ABYSS MODE
==============

5.1	OVERVIEW

If you don't have the time to play a full Adventure game, try the Abyss
mode for a quick fix! Dive as deep as you can into increasingly deadly
waters... how low can you go?

5.2	HOW TO PLAY

Abyss mode works just like Adventure mode, except you don't get any breaks!
It just keeps getting harder and harder until you perish... but how far
down can you make it? What horrible beasts of the deep will you discover?

Type the words on the sides of the oncoming enemies to zap them. When your
Shark Zapper is charged, press ENTER to zap all onscreen enemies at once.

5.3	DEPTH MARKERS

Every 400 feet, your progress in Abyss mode is saved. That means the next
time you play, you can either start at the surface, or at any of the depth
markers you previously set. The status of your Shark Zapper is also saved 
at each depth marker.


=====================
6.0 TYPING TUTOR MODE
=====================

6.1	OVERVIEW

The Typing Tutor will help you to learn touch-typing, if you don't know
it, or improve your skills if you do! You might be surprised at what a
little practice can do!

6.2	HOW TO PLAY

On the sidebar, you will see a description of the current lesson, along
with an Options button and arrows to take you to the previous and next
lessons. You can skip ahead if you want to, but you won't get a "passing"
grade on a lesson until you complete it. Some lessons have specific goals
you must complete, such as finishing it in a certain amount of time or
with a certain degree of accuracy, before they are considered passed.

When you are ready to begin, simply start typing the words as displayed 
at the top of the screen.

6.3	ASSISTANCE

If you watch the keyboard and animated hands below, you will see them 
change to help you improve your typing. The hands will show you which
finger you're supposed to use to strike each key... if you are using
a different finger, you should try to change your habits to use the
proper one.

Likewise, the keyboard will light up to show you the position of the
next key you are supposed to strike.

===========
7.0 SCORING
===========

7.1	GENERAL SCORING

In general, points are earned based on the difficulty of the word being 
typed, as well as the difficulty level selected. Other bonuses are 
awarded based on accuracy, quantity of enemies killed, and other factors.

Here are the values assigned to each character:
ASDFGHJKLE 	  = 1 point
RTYUIMNVB 	  = 2 points
QZXCWPO1234567890 = 3 points
Punctuation 	  = 4 points

The value of the whole word is then multiplied by 15 in adventure mode,
and at least 30 in abyss mode (the value increases the deeper you dive).

BONUS JELLYFISH are scored in the same way, but the points are multiplied 
by the total number of jellyfish killed in the wave. Also, each jellyfish 
killed charges the Shark Zapper by 1%.

An ACCURACY BONUS is awarded if you achieve typing accuracy of 95% or 
better in a wave. This bonus is cumulative for consecutive waves, so if 
you achieve 95% or better accuracy again in the next wave, your bonus will 
be higher. 

Additionally, if you earn 95% or better accuracy during an entire level, 
you will earn bonus points. These bonuses are also cumulative and get higher 
if you earn 95% or better accuracy bonuses on consecutive levels.

The words that appear in the TREASURE SHIP at the end of each level are scored 
differently. Each TREASURE WORD scores the following points:
1700 for X-treme
1000 for Expert
450 for Hard
150 for Normal
50 for Easy

The total point value awarded for the entire Treasure Ship Round is based 
on the number of words typed, as well as the difficulty level.

BOSS MONSTERS are worth the following values:
X-treme = 100,000
Expert 	= 70,000
Hard 	= 50,000
Normal 	= 30,000
Easy 	= 10,000

In Abyss mode the Boss Monsters are worth 100,000 points each.

7.2	EXTRA LIVES

Here are the points required to earn extra lives (applies to Adventure 
Mode only):

Easy: 	 first extra life at 625,000, after that every 400,000
Normal:  first at 775,000, next at 115,000, then every 600,000
Hard: 	 first at 900,000, then 1,550,000, then every 800,000
Expert:  first at 1,250,000 then 1,750,000 then every 1,500,000
X-treme: first at 1,500,000 then 2,000,000 then every 2,000,000
