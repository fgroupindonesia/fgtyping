<TASK>
<HEADING>1</HEADING>
<TEXT>Nobody knows where the treasure is. It is hidden.</TEXT>
<TEXT>Perhaps a shark ate it. We do not know. If so it is lost.</TEXT>
<TEXT>There may have been gold and jewels. Maybe platinum.</TEXT>
<TEXT>Or some kind of stock options. But it will never be found.</TEXT>
</TASK>

<TASK>
<HEADING>2</HEADING>
<TEXT>If you see Mr. Fish, be careful. He may want you to buy</TEXT>
<TEXT>a pig. Dr. Samuels is a better choice for your pork needs.</TEXT>
<TEXT>Bill Monk Jr. can vouch for that. He used to buy from Ms.</TEXT>
<TEXT>Slappy. But now he only buys his pork from Dr. Samuels.</TEXT>
</TASK>

<TASK>
<HEADING>3</HEADING>
<TEXT>Mrs. Hoopy, along with Bill Monk Jr., decided to complain</TEXT>
<TEXT>to Mr. Fish. They believed, incorrectly, that Dr. Samuels</TEXT>
<TEXT>was spiking his pork. Bill Monk Jr.'s dad, Bill Monk Sr.,</TEXT>
<TEXT>tried to tell his son to stop, but it was to no avail.</TEXT>
</TASK>

<TASK>
<HEADING>4</HEADING>
<TEXT>Maybe, he said, Dr. Samuels was just a better pork</TEXT>
<TEXT>seller, but his son would have none of it, believing</TEXT>
<TEXT>what Mrs. Hoopy had told him, despite the clear signs</TEXT>
<TEXT>of deception. Sadly Bill Monk Jr. would not learn.</TEXT>
